Basic log parsing, shows ship to ship and FPS kills

Filterable: Player Kills, Deaths and Other kills (random ships blowing themselves up, etc)

Color coded:
Player deaths in Red
Player kills in Green
Rando deaths in Orange


Use: Run .exe, find your Game.log file (in the Star Citizen installation folder). Leave running to monitor, or run after a death or play session to see what happened. (Note- Game.log is re-created every time you start the game binary.)

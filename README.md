Basic log parsing, shows ship to ship and FPS kills

Filterable: Player Kills, Deaths and Other kills (random ships blowing themselves up, etc)

Color coded:
Player deaths in Red
Player kills in Green
Other ship/NPC deaths in Orange

Note - it's currently difficult/impossible to determine the precise ship instance ID of the player until after the player has been killed, so soft and hard kills of the player ship are color coded as "other kills" in orange.  This will be updated if a new way is found to determine this information from the logs.

Use: Run .exe, find your Game.log file (in the Star Citizen installation folder). Leave running to monitor, or run after a death or play session to see what happened. (Note- Game.log is re-created every time you start the game binary.)
